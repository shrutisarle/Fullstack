                        <p>Hello, I am Shruti Sarle, a sole survivor, a self contained happy entity. In my years of existence I have participated in experiences without an iPhone (it might as well may seem an ice age) to the one with uncalled pressure of excessive social media engagement. Although both version have their own flavor and place in time, I do however yearn for simpler times.</p>
                        <br></br>
                        <p>As a deputy of engineering in computer science. I am in the quest of garnering as much information as I can to learn and contribute towards a fast-paced, multidimensional, dynamic environment in which we dwell in.
                        I strongly believe in teamwork and have a strong passion for driving collaboration across geographically-dispersed and culturally diverse teams.
                        I strive to a carve a niche for myself in the world of machine learning for I am driven by data and the after-effects that it brings about with its intricate associations. My extensive experience in Business Intelligence has been a driving factor for my inclination towards data analytics.</p>
                        <br></br>
                        <p>In my free time youâ€™d find me nibbling on a pizza, or listening to my favorite music while nibbling on a pizza. I love pizza.</p>
