 Inventory Management Web Application Using MERN Stack. 
 
 
•	Begin with an empty array of items. Meaning, when the application loads, nothing will show in the grid initially. It won’t be until you add a new product that those items will begin to appear in the grid.
•	Your category menu should contain: Shirts, Jeans, Jackets, Sweaters, and Accessories.
•	Use the value attribute in the text box for Price Per Unit to pre-populate the $ symbol. However, strip this symbol out before storing the value in your products array. Make sure it’s displayed again within the grid.
•	The Image URL should be a simple reference to an absolute path. This path will be stored in the array as well and then appended to the View link in the grid. 
•	Use React event handling techniques to add your product to an array when the user clicks the Add Product button. Remember, you’ll need to set state here. 
•	If an item is present in the array, it should appear in the gird. The path to the image should be linked from the “View” link and when it’s clicked it should open the image in a new browser window/tab.
•	Don’t forget to account for the fact that each row in the grid will need its own unique key.
